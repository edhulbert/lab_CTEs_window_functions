---------------- COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS ----------------


-- 1. Calculate the average salary of all employees
-- SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary_across_company FROM employees;


-- 2. Calculate the average salary of the employees in each team
-- SELECT departments.id AS department_id , departments.name AS department_name, AVG(employees.salary) AS avg_salary
-- FROM departments
-- LEFT JOIN employees
-- ON departments.id = employees.department_id
-- GROUP BY departments.id, departments.name
-- ORDER BY departments.id;

-- 3. Using a CTE find the ratio of each employees salary to their team average
-- WITH department_avg_salary (department_id, department_name, average_salary) AS
--     (SELECT
--         departments.id, 
--         departments.name, 
--         AVG(employees.salary)
--     FROM departments
--     INNER JOIN employees
--     ON departments.id = employees.department_id
--     GROUP BY departments.id, departments.name
--     ORDER BY departments.id)
-- SELECT
--     employees.id,
--     employees.salary / department_avg_salary.average_salary AS salary_ratio
-- FROM employees
-- INNER JOIN department_avg_salary
-- ON employees.department_id = department_avg_salary.department_id;

-- 4. Find the employee with the highest ratio in Argentina
-- WITH department_avg_salary (department_id, department_name, average_salary) AS
--     (SELECT
--         departments.id, 
--         departments.name, 
--         AVG(employees.salary)
--     FROM departments
--     INNER JOIN employees
--     ON departments.id = employees.department_id
--     GROUP BY departments.id, departments.name
--     ORDER BY departments.id)
-- SELECT
--     employees.id,
--     MAX(employees.salary / department_avg_salary.average_salary) AS salary_ratio
-- FROM employees
-- INNER JOIN department_avg_salary
-- ON employees.department_id = department_avg_salary.department_id
-- WHERE employees.country = 'Argentina'
-- GROUP BY employees.id
-- ORDER BY salary_ratio DESC
-- LIMIT 1;

-- 5. Extension: Add a second CTE calculating the average salary for each country and add a column showing the difference between each employee's salary and their country averageS 
-- WITH country_avg_salary (country_name, average_salary) AS
--     (SELECT
--         country, 
--         AVG(salary)
--     FROM employees
--     GROUP BY country)
-- SELECT
--     employees.id,
--     employees.first_name,
--     employees.last_name,
--     employees.country,
--     employees.salary,
--     employees.salary - country_avg_salary.average_salary AS diff_from_country_avg
-- FROM employees
-- INNER JOIN country_avg_salary
-- ON employees.country = country_avg_salary.country_name;

---------------- WINDOW FUNCTIONS ----------------


-- 1. Find the running total of salary costs as the business has grown and hired more people
-- SELECT 
--     employees.id,
--     employees.start_date,
--     employees.salary,
--     SUM(employees.salary) OVER (ORDER BY employees.start_date) AS salary_running_total
-- FROM employees;

-- 2. Determine if any employees started on the same day (hint: some sort of ranking may be useful here)
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT
        employees.start_date,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY employees.start_date ORDER BY employees.id) AS ranks
    FROM employees) as xyz
 WHERE ranks = 2;
 -- this determines if employees started on the same day by displaying the dates 



-- 3. Find how many employees there are from each country

-- 4. Show how the average salary cost for each department has changed as the number of employees has increased

-- 5. Extension: Research the EXTRACT function and use it in conjunction with PARTITION and COUNT to show how many employees started working for BusinessCorpâ„¢ each year. If you're feeling adventurous you could further partition by month...



---------------- COMBINING THE TWO ----------------


-- 1. Find the maximum and minimum salaries

-- 2. Find the difference between the maximum and minimum salaries and each employee's own salary

-- 3. Order the employees by start date. Research how to calculate the median salary value and the standard deviation in salary values and show how these change as more employees join the company

-- 4. Limit this query to only Research & Development team members and show a rolling value for only the 5 most recent employees.
